This is just my way to figure out how Edward Kmett's many libraries go together. Credit for everything goes to him. This isn't for any kind of use. If I could make this repo private I would, but I have a free Github account.

## Notes
* `Extend` is not a superclass of `Comonoad`, but should be.
* `Divise` is not a superclass of `Divisible`, but should be.
* `Choose` is not a superclass of `Decidable`, but should be.
* `Decidable` is not a superclass of `Contravariant.Representable`, but should be.
